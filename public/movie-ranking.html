<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Batman: The Dark Knight</h3>
<p>Props to the director, and actors for making this masterpiece</p>

<h3>Deja Vu</h3>
<p> Did not know it was a movie about time travel until the climax (unlike other time travel movies)</p>
<h3> Avengers: Infinity War</h3>
<p> Yes, I know it's lame. But I love my comics, and the villain was absolutely fantastic in this one</p>
